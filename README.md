Tic-Tac-Toe Web Application is a browser-based game built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project provides an engaging two-player gaming experience with a responsive user interface and dynamic gameplay. Players take turns marking cells in a 3x3 grid as either "X" or "O", and the game automatically checks for winning combinations or a draw. The interface includes a real-time status update for each player's turn and a reset button to start a new match instantly.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate core front-end development skills such as DOM manipulation, event handling, conditional rendering, and basic game logic â€” all without using any libraries or frameworks. Whether you're a beginner learning JavaScript or a developer looking to build simple interactive apps, this project serves as a great starting point.

You can further extend this project by adding features like:

a)Single-player mode against a computer AI 

b)Sound effects for actions and wins 

c)Scoreboard tracking 

d)Mobile responsiveness
